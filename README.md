# Analyzing Amazon Electronics Sales Data with Python and Visualizing Data in PowerBI

## Overview

This project leverages Python for data analysis and PowerBI for data visualization to provide insights into Amazon Electronics Sales Data. The goal is to analyze sales trends, customer behaviors, and product performance to drive data-informed decisions.

## Project Structure

- Data Collection: Importing and preprocessing the sales data using Python.

- The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edusanketdk/electronics

- Data Analysis: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.

- Data Visualization: Creating dynamic and interactive visualizations with PowerBI.

## Key Features

### Data Preprocessing:

- Handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.

- Normalizing and cleaning the dataset for accurate analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyzing sales trends over different periods (daily, monthly, yearly).

- Identifying top-selling products and categories.

- Examining customer demographics and behavior patterns.

- Data Visualization:

- Using PowerBI to create interactive dashboards.

- Visualizing key metrics such as total sales, average sales per category, and customer segmentation.

- Generating insights on sales performance through dynamic charts and graphs.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- PowerBI: Data visualization and dashboard creation

- GitHub: Version control and project collaboration
